# Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) Representation

Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) representation refers to the various ways in which the interactions between proteins can be represented or encoded. PPI representations aim to capture the structural, functional, and relational aspects of protein interactions and are used in various computational methods and analyses.
Methods used for representation:

* [Node2vec](https://www.kdd.org/kdd2016/papers/files/rfp0218-groverA.pdf)

* [Higher-Order Proximity preserved Embedding (HOPE)](https://www.kdd.org/kdd2016/papers/files/rfp0184-ouA.pdf)

Node2Vec and HOPE are a popular algorithm used for generating node embeddings in network analysis, including graph-based protein representations. It is a representation learning method that learns low-dimensional vector representations, or embeddings, for nodes in a graph.

## Data Format
### Edge List
-Read and write NetworkX graphs as edge lists.

-With the edgelist format simple edge data can be stored

*Example:
 
 <table>
<tr><th> Interaction data </th><th></th><th></th><th> Edgelist Data </th></tr>
<tr><td>
 
|Interaction A|Interaction B|                
| ------------| ------------|
|  P05089     |   P05362    |
|  P05362	    |   P14902    |
|  P14902     |   P16410    |
|  P15692     |   P14902    |
|  P16070     |   P14902    |
|  P16410     |   P05362    |

</td><td></th><th></th><th>
 
|Interaction A|Interaction B|
| ------------| ------------|
|  0    |   1    |
|  1    |   2    |
|  2    |   5    |

#### How to run methods 
* Our users who have installed Hoper do not need to perform the following operations.
  
* If you have not installed Hoper, you must perform the steps below to run PPI.
  
* Dependencies are imported first.

* Create edgelist (input data)  Please refer  **edgelist_code.py**

* If you are going to use the IntAct database, Preprocessing is required for the IntAct database.The relevant code for 
 this  https://github.com/serbulent/HOPER/blob/main/ppi_representations/data_preprocess.py  

* To install packages to use for Node2vec and HOPE in your home directory, use:

  * GEM version 213189b; use for old version:
  
    git clone [https://github.com/palash1992/GEM.git]
    
    git checkout  [213189b]

* To make Node2vec executable; Clone repository git clone https://github.com/snap-stanford/snap and Compiles SNAP. The code for compiles is as below:
  
  - cd snap/
  - rm -rf examples/Release
  - make all
  - cd examples/node2vec
  - chmod +x node2vec
  - ls -alh node2vec

* Make node2vec executable and add to system PATH or move it to the location you run.

* Identify the protein names corresponding to the nodes(Reproduction/ppi_representations/data/proteins_id.csv)

You can make protein names using **edgelist_code.py** These names will be needed later for the node2vec.py and HOPE.py files. Do not forget the location information.

  
* You can use small sample for application . The sample interaction is randomly generated (Reproduction/ppi_representations/data/small_example.xlsx) 
 
* Set parameters

* Create representations


It can be run  as python Node2vec.py and HOPE.py(input data: .edgelist file and proteins id names file **ppi_representations/data**)

Node2vec and HOPE outputs are recorded in **ppi_representations/data**.
